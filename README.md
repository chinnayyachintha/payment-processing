# Payment Process Flow

This document outlines the typical steps involved in a payment process, including transaction processing, storing transaction data, maintaining an audit trail, and creating periodic backups for data compliance, recovery, and auditing.

## Flow for Payment Process

1. **Trigger the Payment Request**:
   - A user initiates a payment request for a purchase, subscription, or similar transaction.
   - The payment request is sent to the payment processor, such as the Flair Payment Gateway or another provider.

2. **Payment Gateway Processes the Payment**:
   - The payment processor (e.g., Elavon) processes the payment by:
     - Validating payment credentials.
     - Checking for sufficient funds.
     - Applying any discounts or additional charges.
     - Confirming the transaction.
   - After processing, a response is generated indicating a successful or failed transaction.

3. **Record Payment in DynamoDB**:
   - If the payment is successful, transaction details, including the user, amount, transaction ID, and payment status, are recorded in DynamoDB.

4. **Create Audit Trail**:
   - Alongside transaction details, an audit trail is created to log:
     - Who processed the payment.
     - When the transaction occurred.
     - Transaction details.
     - The outcome (e.g., "Payment Success" or "Payment Failed").
   - This audit trail is stored in a DynamoDB table (e.g., `PaymentAuditTrail`).

5. **Backup Payment Data**:
   - Payment data and audit logs are backed up periodically in Amazon S3 using a Lambda function scheduled via CloudWatch Events.
   - The backup file is stored in the S3 bucket with a timestamp, allowing for easy recovery if needed.

## Payment Process Backup Flow

1. **Lambda Function for Backup**:
   - The Lambda function scans the DynamoDB `PaymentAuditTrail` table for records (e.g., successful or failed transactions).
   - The scan result is serialized into a JSON file.

2. **Storing in S3**:
   - The JSON backup file is stored in S3 with a unique key based on the timestamp.
   - Backups can be scheduled daily or periodically for auditing purposes.

# Payment Process Flow

This document describes the payment processing flow, including data storage, audit logging, and backup for traceability and compliance.

## Flow for Payment Processing

### 1. User Triggers Payment Request

- A user initiates a payment request through the application.

### 2. Payment Gateway Processes Payment

- The payment gateway processes the payment by communicating with the payment processor and deducting the specified amount from the user's payment method.
- A response is generated indicating whether the payment was successful or failed.

### 3. Store Transaction Data in DynamoDB

- After a successful payment, the transaction details are stored in DynamoDB.
- Stored transaction data includes:
  - Transaction ID
  - User ID
  - Amount Paid
  - Payment Status

### 4. Create Audit Trail

- An audit trail entry is created in DynamoDB for each transaction, recording:
  - Who made the payment
  - When the payment was processed
  - Transaction details
  - Payment outcome (e.g., "Payment Successful" or "Payment Failed")

### 5. Backup Data to S3

- A Lambda function periodically backs up transaction data and audit logs to Amazon S3.
- Backups are stored in JSON format and include a timestamp for easy retrieval.

### 6. Schedule Periodic Backups with CloudWatch Events

- CloudWatch Events are used to trigger the Lambda function at scheduled intervals (e.g., daily) for creating backups.
- This helps ensure data redundancy and availability.

## Payment Process:

###### User triggers payment request → Payment gateway processes payment → DynamoDB stores transaction data → Audit trail created in DynamoDB → Backup to S3 (Lambda) → Periodically schedule backups with CloudWatch Events
